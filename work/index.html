<p>
  I have experience in designing interfaces for desktop and mobile — from mockups and wireframes
  to their final stage. I've conducted usability testing and user research,
  delivered front-end style guides and created UI prototypes.
  I work mostly with paper and Sketch.
</p>

<p>
  I also have experience in developing websites — I've worked with WordPress,
  Jekyll, and other frameworks. I write CSS and HTML daily, JS occasionaly.
