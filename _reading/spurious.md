quotes:
- "It's a great mystery to him, his eternal capacity for hope and the eternal destruction of his capacity for hope."
- "It's our great fortune to live at the periphery."
- "I keep a mental list of W.'s favourite questions, which he constantly asks me so as to ask himself. â€” 'At what point did you realise that you would amount to nothing?'; 'When was it that you first became aware you would be nothing but a failure?'; 'When you look back at your life, what do you see?'; 'How is it that you know what greatness is, and that you will never, ever reach it?'"
