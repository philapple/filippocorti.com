quotes:
  - "A free man should walk slowly, that's what the Greeks thought, says W. The slave hurries, but the free man can take all day."
  - "It's a sign of the end, he says, when you can no longer make real distinctions."
  - "I live each day as though it were the day after the last."
  - "For me, the afternoon's always planning-time, world conquest-time, as W. calls it. I have to pretend to some kind of hold on the future, W. has noticed. It's like climber throwing up grappling hook, or Spiderman swinging by his squirted webs. I'm never happy in the moment, W. says. I'm never happy in the belly of the afternoon."
