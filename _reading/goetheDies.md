quotes:
- "If Shopenhauer and Stifter were still alive, I would invite them both along with Wittgenstein, but Shopenhauer and Stifter are no longer alive, so I will only invite Wittgenstein. And when I think of it just now, thus said Goethe at the window, with his right hand supported by his cane, Wittgenstein is the greatest of all."
- "Every remark of mine was met by their misunderstanding and with this misunderstanding their assiduous vulgarity. Thus over the decades I have said less and less and finally nothing more, and their lectures have become evermore ruthless."
- "Waking up was nothing more than looking into hell."
