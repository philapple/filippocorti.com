quotes:
- "We have to hope that the people who love us and who know us a little bit will in the end have seen us truly. In the end, not much else matters"
- "The lifelong friends, he said. We sometimes wait a lifetime for them."
- "That's the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will, it's in their nature."
- "It's all right to forget, you know, he said. It's good to. In fact, we have to forget things sometimes. Forgetting it is important. We do it on purpose. It means we get a bit of a rest. Are you listening? We have to forget. Or we'd never sleep ever again."
