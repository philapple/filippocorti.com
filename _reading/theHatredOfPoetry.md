quotes:
  - "The more abysmal the experience of the actual, the greater the implied heights of the virtual."
  - "Our contempt for any particular poem must be perfect, be total, because only a ruthless reading that allows us to measure the gap between the actual and the virtual will enable to to experience, if not a genuine poem—no such thing—a place for the genuine, whatever that might mean."
